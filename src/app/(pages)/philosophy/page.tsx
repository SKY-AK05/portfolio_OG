        <ThoughtCard title="Start with Friction" sketchUrl="https://placehold.co/400x200.png" rotation="rotate-2" hint="gears sketch">
          <p>Instead of chasing a frictionless experience, I start by understanding the existing friction. What makes a task hard? Where does anxiety creep in? Acknowledging the struggle is the first step to designing a truly helpful solution.</p>

        <ThoughtCard title="Calm by Default" sketchUrl="https://placehold.co/400x200.png" rotation="-rotate-1" hint="zen garden">
          <p>No autoplaying videos, no urgent notification badges, no competing calls-to-action. Technology should be a quiet, reliable partner. Calm is not a feature to be toggled on; it's the foundation.</p>
        </ThoughtCard>

        <ThoughtCard title="Emotion-First UI" sketchUrl="https://placehold.co/400x200.png" rotation="rotate-1" hint="heart interface">
          <p>How does this interface make someone feel? Confident? Anxious? Supported? The emotional impact of a design is as important as its functionality. I prioritize creating UIs that feel safe, predictable, and encouraging.</p>
        </ThoughtCard>

        <ThoughtCard title="Structure as Kindness" sketchUrl="https://placehold.co/400x200.png" rotation="-rotate-2" hint="scaffolding blueprint">
          <p>For a mind that struggles with executive function, clear structure isn't restrictiveâ€”it's liberating. Well-designed constraints, clear hierarchies, and guided pathways are acts of kindness that reduce cognitive load.</p>
        </ThoughtCard>

        <ThoughtCard title="Sustainable Pacing" sketchUrl="https://placehold.co/400x200.png" rotation="rotate-2" hint="plant growing">
          <p>This applies to how I build and what I build. I avoid the "move fast and break things" mindset. I also design tools that encourage users to work at a sustainable pace, respecting their natural rhythms and energy levels.</p>
        </ThoughtCard>
        
        <ThoughtCard title="Clarity over Cleverness" sketchUrl="https://placehold.co/400x200.png" rotation="-rotate-1" hint="lightbulb simple">
          <p>A clever animation or a novel UI pattern is worthless if it creates confusion. I always opt for the clearest possible path. The goal is to make the user feel smart and capable, not to show off a clever design.</p>
